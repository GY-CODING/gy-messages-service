## Introduction

GY Messages is the official GYCODING's messaging product, allowing users from different devices or even GYCODING products to be connected and send messages.

<br>

## How it was made

![Spring](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring-6DB33F?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white)
![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-4EA94B?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2CA5E0?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)

This API REST uses **Spring Web** for the whole API REST functionality and **Spring Data** to access to our **MongoDB** database. For the deployment, **Docker** is being used along with **Koyeb** for the hosting.

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)

The reference static website was made using just **HTML**, **CSS** and some **JavaScript**, while the documentation was made automatically using **Dokka** for the Code Docs and **Postman** for the API Docs.
